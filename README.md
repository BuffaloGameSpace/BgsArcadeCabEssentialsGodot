# BGS Cab Essentials
## A Godot Plugin and Demo Scene

![logo](icon.svg)

The BGS Cab Essentials plugin for Godot is meant to make some things a bit easier when developing games for the BGS Arcade Cabinet located at Buffalo Game Space. When you install and enable the plugin in your project, you'll get:
- An autoload for keeping track of and redeeming credits, complete with signals your scripts can connect to for notification of credit availability and redemption
- Another autoload for autoquitting the game after a configurable amount of seconds with no user input
- An editor UI for handling cabinet-specific settings and assigning Input Map actions to the arcade cabinet controls
